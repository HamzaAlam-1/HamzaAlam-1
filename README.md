My first time coding was back in middle school. When I was 13, I accomplished my first task of coding, a remote control car that I myself built and coded using python which infact was my first ever programming languages I learned. Eversince I have been fascinated by what is computer scinece and programming. And that passion has brought me to where I am today. Student at one of the best universties in the country, UIC. UIC has taught more than just coding. Getting experiecne in data structures, debugging, team work.
