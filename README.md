My first time coding was back in middle school. When I was 13, I accomplished my first task of coding, a remote control car that I myself built and coded using python which infact was my first ever programming languages I learned. Eversince I have been fascinated by what is computer scinece and programming. And that passion has brought me to where I am today. Student at one of the best universities in the country, UIC. UIC has taught more than just coding. Getting experience in data structures, debugging, team work. I hope to bring this experience to companies that are looking for something new or a change.
